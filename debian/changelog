ros-indigo-grizzly-motion (0.3.2-0saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * Added a precharge check before transitioning into MOVING state. Without this,
    precharges that take longer than 2.0 seconds will cause stuttering issues if
    there is already a cmd_vel being sent.
  * Added estop check in watchdog callback for the Moving state. Without this, the
    state machine will get stuck in the Moving state if the vehicle is estopped while
    there is still a stream of motion commands being sent.
